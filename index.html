    <p>All modern websites and web applications are built using three fundamental technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the web.</p>
    
    <p>In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about, and why you too should learn it.</p>
    
   <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
    
    <p>HTML stands for <b>H</b>yper<b>T</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage. It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a programming language).</p>
    
    <p>HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.</p>
    <br>
    In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:
<ol>
    <li>The opening tag
    <li>The closing tag
    <li>The actual element
</ol>
    
    <h3>Why should you learn HTML?</h3>
    
    <p>There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the web. Here are 5 of them:</p>
<ul> 
    <li>To be able to use the fundamental web dev language
    <li>To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like Worpress or Wix
    <li>To build web applications
    <li>To impress friends
    <li>To have fun ðŸ˜ƒ
</ul>
